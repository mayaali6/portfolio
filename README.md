### Projects 
The Effect of Nicotine on C. elegan’s Response to Noxious Heat (Nov-Dec 2023)
- The relationship between the TRPC pathway (activated via nicotine) and the TRPV pathway (activated via noxious heat and capsaicin) was investigated by exposing C.elegans to various doses of nicotine and capsaicin and placing them on thermal heat apparatus
- Distribution of the worms across the heat gradient showed that some experimental groups were able to withstand the painful heat, indicating that the TRPC pathway could be mediating TRPV
